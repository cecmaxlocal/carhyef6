# carheyf6

A comprehensive digital ecosystem for managing distributed tasks and resources. The project is inspired by the efficient, decentralized systems found in nature, such as ants managing pebbles and bees producing honey.

---

## 核心理念 (Core Philosophy)

*   **Ants**: Small, independent worker processes or scripts that perform specific, granular tasks.
*   **Litter**: Temporary or disposable data and logs that are managed and cleaned up efficiently.
*   **Pebbles**: Core data units or assets; the fundamental building blocks managed by the system.
*   **Bee**: The client-facing applications (Web, Desktop) that interact with the core system.
*   **Honey**: The valuable output or API data produced by the servers, consumed by the "Bees".

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into a modular structure to separate concerns and facilitate development across different parts of the platform.

### Component Breakdown

*   **`servers/`**: The backend powerhouse. This is where the `Honey` API is served and where the `Pebbles` data is processed and stored.
*   **`client/`, `web/`, `desktop/`**: The `Bee` interfaces. These are the user-facing applications that allow interaction with the system.
*   **`script/`**: Contains various `Ants` (utility scripts) for automation, building, and maintenance, including scripts for `Litter` collection (log cleanup).
*   **`app/`**: The core application logic that ties all the different modules together.
*   **`lib/` & `bin/`**: Contains shared libraries and final compiled binaries.
*   **`doc/` & `image/`**: Project documentation and static assets.
*   **`test/`**: Ensures the reliability and quality of all components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (e.g., v18.x)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
